							<p>I have always been passionate in gaming, and have always dreamed of being a part of the gaming industry in any way possible such as through content creation, playing professionally, and also developing my own game. Although I enjoy playing games very much, I feel like if I can develop my own game then I can share that same I joy I feel when they play my game. </p>
							<p>In 2020, during the MCO, I discovered Dani's YouTube channel. After watching a few of his videos I became inspired to be like him. He is an entertaining guy while also being very creative and proficient in developing his games. Although I do not have enough time and resources to be a content creator, I hope that one day I am able to become a game developer who is well received by the community.</p>
